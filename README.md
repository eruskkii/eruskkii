👋 Hi, I’m Emmanuel ( @eruskkii )

I work at the intersection of content systems, product storytelling, and software. 
I’m backend-leaning (Java, Spring Boot, SQL) and I’m especially interested in AI-assisted workflows that help media and fintech teams move faster.

🔧 Tech I use
- Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker
- Basic frontend: JavaScript, React
- AI tooling: prompt systems, evaluation, workflow automation

🧠 What I’m exploring
- Small backend services and APIs
- Data and text workflows for digital media (audience behaviour, engagement, distribution)
- Practical AI: summarisation, classification, extraction, and research pipelines

🤝 Open to collaborating on
- Backend projects with clean APIs and good docs
- Data projects focused on media or customer behaviour
- Tools that make research and publishing faster
